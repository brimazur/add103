<h2>How to Cut Hair: A Step-by-Step Guide to a Short, Layered Pixie Haircut </h2>
<p>Since you now know how to cut layers on longer hair, let's try something shorter. A pixie haircut is a fun and stylish look that’s easy to care for! The short layers give the hair texture, volume, and a modern edge. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can do it in 8 easy steps:</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Step 1: </h2>
<h2> Prepare the Hair</h2>
<p>Start by washing the hair and towel-drying it until it’s damp. Use the spray bottle to lightly mist it with water if it’s drying out. This will make it easier to cut.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Step 2: </h2>
 <h2>Section the Hair</h2>
<p>Divide the hair into manageable sections: the back, sides, and top. Use hair clips to separate each section for easier cutting.</p>

<h2>Step 3: </h2>
<h2>Begin with the Back</h2>
<p>Start at the nape (the lowest part of the back). Comb the hair down and hold it at a slight 45-degree angle to create a soft, gradual cut. Trim in small sections to ensure an even look, keeping the back short for a true pixie style.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Step 4: </h2>
<h2>Move to the Sides</h2>
<p>For the sides, comb the hair down and cut at a 45-degree angle. Hold each section between your fingers to keep the hair in place as you cut. This angle allows the sides to blend smoothly with the back, creating a natural flow.</p>

<h2>Step 5: </h2>
<h2> Layer the Top at a 90-Degree Angle</h2>
<p>The top section is where you’ll create volume with layers. Pull each section of hair straight up from the scalp and hold it at a 90-degree angle to the head. Cut small, choppy pieces to create short layers that add texture and lift to the hair.</p>

<h2>Step 6: </h2>
<h2>Blend the Layers for a Smooth Finish</h2>
<p>Work around the top and sides to blend the layers together. Check that the angles connect smoothly so that the hair doesn’t look choppy. You can use a 45-degree angle on the outer layers to blend into the 90-degree top layers for a soft, layered effect.</p>
<br>
<h2>Step 7: </h2>
<h2>Trim the Bangs</h2>
<p>Trim the bangs to frame the face. You can cut them at a slight angle to create a softer look or straight across for a bold finish.</p>

<h2>Step 8: </h2>
<h2>Final Touches</h2>
<p>Use thinning shears or regular shears to remove any bulk from the layers and make the cut look light and even. Style with a bit of texturizing product to give the pixie cut its full, stylish look.</p>
