<h2>How to Cut Hair: A Step-by-Step Guide to Layered Haircuts</h2>
<p>Now that you know the basics of the blunt, one length cut, let's go one step foward. One popular hairstyle is the layered cut, which adds volume and movement to hair. </p>
<p>Here’s how you can do it in 9 easy steps:</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Step 1: </h2>
<h2>Prepare the Hair</h2>
<p>Start by washing the hair and towel-drying it until it’s damp. Use the spray bottle to lightly mist it with water if it’s drying out. This will make it easier to cut.</p>
<br><br><br><br>

<h2>Step 2: </h2>
<h2>Section the Hair</h2>
<p>Use hair clips to divide the hair into three sections: two on the sides and one in the back. Divide the back section down the middle and clip into two more sections. This helps keep things organized so you can work with one part of the hair at a time.</p>

<h2>Step 3: </h2>
<h2>Choose Your Angle for Layer Length</h2>
<div id="layerlist"> 
    <ul>
        <img src="images/layer-2.jpg" alt="short layers"> <li>For Short Layers: Hold the hair at a 90-degree angle from the scalp. This angle creates shorter layers and more volume. It's ideal for styles where you want a lot of bounce and a defined layered look.</li>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <img src="images/layer-3.jpg" alt="long layers"> <li>For Long Layers: Hold the hair at a 45-degree angle from the scalp. This angle creates longer layers that blend more subtly and look softer, adding movement without losing length.</li>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    </ul>
</div>
      
<h2>Step 4: </h2>
<h2>Start Cutting</h2>
<p>Create the first layer. Decide on the length for the first (top) layer. Comb a section of hair from the top, lift it to your chosen angle (I'll be showing you a 45 here), and cut the ends straight across. This first cut sets the length for the rest of the layers.</p>

<h2>Step 5: </h2>
<h2>Move to the Next Section</h2>
<p> Lift a small piece from this section and hold it with a piece from the first layer. Using the first layer as a guide, cut the new section slightly longer than the layer above it. Continue this process around the head.</p>

<h2>Step 6: </h2>
<h2> Repeat on the Other Side</h2>
<p>Release the clipped section and repeat the same steps on the other side of the head.</p>
<br>

<h2>Step 7: </h2>
<h2>Add texture</h2>
<p>After you have your basic layers, you can “point cut” the ends. This means holding the shears at an angle and snipping into the ends to create a softer look and add texture.</p>
<br>

<h2>Step 8: </h2>
<h2>Check for Evenness</h2>
<p>Look in the mirror and make sure the layers are even all around. Adjust any sections that seem too long or uneven.</p>

<h2>Step 9: </h2>
<h2>Style the Hair</h2>
<p>After the cut is finished, you can style the hair to enhance the look. For a smooth, sleek finish, blow-dry the hair with a round brush. If you’d like, you can also use hot tools, like a flat iron or curling wand, to create different looks.</p>
