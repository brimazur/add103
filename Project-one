    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Brianna Mazur, and I’m excited to share a little about myself with you.</p>

    <img src="images/me-headshot.jpeg" alt="headshot">

    <p>I have a huge passion for animals, especially my dogs. They are not just pets to me; they are my best friends! I also adore cats, opossums, raccoons, and really all animals. I believe every creature has something special to offer, and I love spending time with them whenever I can.<p>

    <p>When I’m not surrounded by furry friends, you can find me working as a hairdresser. I enjoy making people feel beautiful and confident. There’s something magical about transforming someone’s look, and I love connecting with my clients while doing what I love. I enjoy coloring my own hair just as much as I love coloring others'—I’ve done every color, from vibrant purple to mixed blues, and even rainbow! <p>

    <p>Outside of work, I cherish spending time with my boyfriend and my friends. We love hanging out, sharing laughs, and creating memories together. Whether we’re going out for ice cream or having craft nights at home, it’s always a great time!<p>

        <img src="images/friends-k-o-b.JPG" alt="friends">
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is doing crafts. I’m especially into crocheting, making jewelry, and creating string friendship bracelets. There’s something really satisfying about making something with my own hands. Crafting is a fun way for me to unwind and express my creativity. I love making special gifts for my friends and family, and I’m always excited to try out new projects.</p>

    <p>Another hobby of mine is collecting rocks and crystals. Each rock and crystal has its own unique beauty and story, and I find joy in discovering new pieces for my collection. I love going different places to hunt for rocks in the wild. I also love collecting little toy trinkets.</p>

    <p>That’s a bit about me! I’m an animal lover, a dedicated hairdresser, and a creative person who enjoys all sorts of hobbies. </p>
